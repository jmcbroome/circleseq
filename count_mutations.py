#the following functions are intended to construct a tracking structure which can identify and ignore likely PCR duplicate errors

#we use a permuter which generates random sequences with an equal length and number of alternatives, measures median distance between each instances of the alternative allele, and determines whether a given read has an average density of alternative alleles which falls below this threshold
